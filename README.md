# Defense-In-Depth
In today's digital world, where security threats are increasing rapidly, it is crucial to implement a robust defense strategy. The Defense-in-Depth Security Architecture for Linux Web Applications project implements a multi-layered security strategy to safeguard both infrastructure and applications. This starts with the top-layer policy, procedures, and awareness, which enforce strong password policies to secure user credentials. Perimeter and internal network security are enhanced through the use of TLS certificates, iptables and xtables firewalls, and IDS/IPS systems like Snort to prevent unauthorized access and monitor network traffic. Host security includes automated package updates, changes to default SSH ports, Fail2Ban protection, SSH access logging, and MFA for SSH to ensure system integrity. Application security is achieved through effective user authentication, the deployment of ModSecurity WAF with integrated OWASP, and hiding Apache header banners. Finally, data security is maintained with MariaDB encryption and scheduled daily backups to protect against data loss.  This multi-layered approach delivers comprehensive protection, addressing various security challenges and ensuring both infrastructure and application security.
